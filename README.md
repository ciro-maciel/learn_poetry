# Learn: Poetry for Python

Welcome to the repository for learning how using Poetry in Python projects. This repository serves as a resource for developers looking to adopt Poetry into their workflows.

## What is Poetry?

Poetry is a dependency and package management tool for Python that makes it easy to create and manage isolated environments and simplify package publishing.

## About the Project

This project aims to provide a solid foundation on how to use Poetry for managing packages and virtual environments in Python. Includes practical examples, step-by-step tutorials, and detailed explanations.

### Poetry Installation

With Python installed on your computer, you can install Poetry, run the following command:

```bash
$ pip install poetry
```

To check the version of Poetry, run the following command:

```bash
$ poetry --version
```

### Poetry Configuration

To configure Poetry, run the following command:

```bash
$ poetry config virtualenvs.in-project true
```

To see the current configuration, run the following command:

```bash
$ poetry config --list
```

### Project Creation

How to start a new project with Poetry.

```bash
$ poetry init
```

In the folder, you will see a `pyproject.toml` file with the Poetry configuration.

### Dependency Management

Add, remove and update packages with ease.

```bash
$ poetry add [package name]
```

Remove packages with ease.

```bash
$ poetry remove [package name]
```

To show the current dependencies, run the following command:

```bash
$ poetry show
```

### Run Commands

To install the dependencies, run the following command:

```bash
$ poetry install
```

The shell command spawns a shell within the projectâ€™s virtual environment.

```bash
$ poetry shell
```

As such, `exit` should be used to properly exit the shell.

Run Poetry commands with ease.

```bash
$ python src/github.py
```

```bash
$ python src/birthdate.py
```

```bash
$ python src/frequency.py
```

### Managing Environments

If you want to get basic information about the currently activated virtual environment

```bash
$ poetry env info
```

You can also list all the virtual environments associated with the current project

```bash
$ poetry env list
```

Delete existing virtual environments

```bash
$ poetry env remove [virtual environment name]
```

Use the `--all` option to delete all virtual environments at once.

### Version Control

To check the current version of Poetry, run the following command:

```bash
$ poetry version
```

To update the version of Poetry, run the following table:

| RULE  | BEFORE | AFTER |
| ----- | ------ | ----- |
| major | 1.3.0  | 2.0.0 |
| minor | 2.1.4  | 2.2.0 |
| patch | 4.1.1  | 4.1.2 |

```bash
$ poetry version [major|minor|patch]
```
